# Opening a PR in task-manager-api

## Before opening

1. Confirm you're not on `main` (`git branch --show-current`) - a PR needs a feature branch.
2. Run the full test suite and make sure it's green:
   ```bash
   JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21) ./mvnw test
   ```
   A red PR wastes the reviewer's time. If something is failing and the user wants to open
   the PR anyway (e.g. to get early feedback on a draft), open it as `--draft` and say so.
3. Find the base branch rather than assuming `main`:
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name
   ```
4. Read the real commits that will go into the PR - this is the source of truth for the
   description, not a restatement of the conversation that produced them:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline <base>..HEAD
   git diff <base>...HEAD
   ```
   If there are no commits ahead of base, say so and stop rather than opening an empty PR.

## Collecting related issues from the commits

Every commit in this repo carries a `closes|fixes|refs #<N>` reference (the `github-commit`
skill's format). Scan `git log <base>..HEAD` for those and carry them into the PR body verbatim -
`closes`/`fixes` stay as closing keywords so GitHub auto-closes the issue on merge, `refs` stays a
plain reference. Don't invent an issue number if a commit doesn't have one.

## Writing the description

```markdown
## What
One or two sentences on what this PR does.

## Related issues
Closes #<N>
Refs #<N>

## Changes
- Bullet points of the specific changes, grouped by area
- Call out which architecture layer(s) moved: domain / application / infrastructure
- Mention any files deleted, renamed, or any migration added

## Testing
How this was verified - e.g. "57 tests pass (`./mvnw verify`, including JaCoCo's coverage
gate and the ArchUnit rule for X)" or "manually verified via `docker compose up` + curl".
```

Keep it proportional to the change - a one-file typo fix doesn't need every section filled out
at length, but don't skip "Related issues" (every commit has one by convention) or "Why" content
even for small changes; that's the part a reviewer can't get from the diff alone.

## Opening it

Publishing a PR is outward-facing and semi-public (teammates get notified, CI may run) - show
the user the title and full description before running `gh pr create`, the same way you'd
confirm before sending a message on someone's behalf. Once confirmed:

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
gh pr create --title "<type>: <short summary>" --body "<description>"
```

For long descriptions, write the body to a temp file and use `--body-file` instead of fighting
shell quoting. Relay the resulting PR URL back to the user.

If the repo has no `origin` remote or `gh` isn't authenticated (`gh auth status`), say so and
stop rather than trying to work around it.

## Updating an existing open PR

When more commits land on a branch that already has an open PR, GitHub updates the diff and
commit list on its own, but **the body does not** - a description written for the earlier state
goes stale and starts misleading reviewers. Redo the "collecting related issues" and "writing
the description" steps against the *current* `git log <base>..HEAD`, then:

```bash
git push
gh pr edit <number> --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

Find the PR number for the current branch with `gh pr view --json number -q .number` if you
don't already have it. Same confirmation rule as creation - show the new body first.

## This skill never merges

Opening or updating a PR is as far as this goes. A human reviews and approves every merge in
this repo - never run `gh pr merge`, never suggest the branch is "ready to merge" as if that's
your call to make. If the user asks you to merge a PR, tell them that's a step they need to do
themselves (or explicitly delegate to a human reviewer), not something this skill performs.

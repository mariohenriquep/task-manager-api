description: Write commit messages and structure commits for the task-manager-api repo (Java 21 / Spring Boot, TDD, onion architecture) — every commit must reference a GitHub issue. Use this whenever the user asks to commit changes, wants a commit message drafted, says "commit this", finishes implementing something and it's time to check it in, or is about to run `git commit` for any change in this repo, however small.

# Committing in task-manager-api

## Before committing

Run the test suite and make sure it's green:

```bash
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21) ./mvnw test
```

(The default `java` on this machine isn't 21, hence the explicit `JAVA_HOME`.) A commit that
introduces a broken build defeats the point of the TDD/CI setup this project is built around -
don't commit red. If the user explicitly wants to checkpoint broken work anyway, that's their
call, but say so out loud first rather than silently committing a failing build.

Also check what branch you're on (`git branch --show-current`). Beyond the very first
scaffolding commits, work should happen on a feature branch, not directly on `main` - create
one (`git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>`) before committing if you're still on `main`.

## Message format

Every commit references a GitHub issue - that's what makes `git log` traceable back to the work
that motivated it, and it's non-negotiable here even for small changes:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>, <ref-keyword> #<issue_number>
```

- **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`.
- **scope** (optional but useful here): the architecture layer or feature touched - `domain`,
  `application`, `infrastructure`, `web`, `persistence` - since this repo is organized around
  onion architecture and the scope makes it obvious at a glance which layer changed.
- **subject**: imperative mood, no trailing period - "add due-date validation to Task", not
  "added" or "adds".
- **ref-keyword**: `closes` | `fixes` | `refs`.
  - `closes`/`fixes` - this commit is the piece of work that satisfies the issue (GitHub
    auto-closes it when merged to `main`). Interchangeable.
  - `refs` - related to the issue but doesn't resolve it (partial progress, or one of several
    commits contributing to the same issue).

A commit can reference more than one issue - most often when it finishes a sub-issue and thereby
also completes its parent: repeat the keyword per issue, comma-separated
(`… , closes #22, closes #19`), and keywords can mix (`… , closes #22, refs #19`) when the
commit resolves one but only advances the other.

**Finding the issue number:**
- If the user names one, use it.
- Otherwise look for a matching open issue: `gh issue list`. If more than one plausibly matches,
  ask rather than guessing.
- If genuinely no issue exists yet, stop and ask whether to file one first (the `github-issues`
  skill covers that) - never fabricate a number or silently drop the reference; that defeats the
  whole point of the format.

**Examples:**
```
feat(domain): add reopen transition to Task aggregate, closes #14
test(application): cover ChangeTaskStatusService invalid-transition case, refs #14
fix(persistence): map due_date column as nullable, fixes #21
refactor(web): extract TaskWebMapper from controller, refs #9
chore: bump archunit to 1.4.2, closes #25
feat(domain): add Task priority field, closes #30, closes #28
```
(the last one finishes sub-issue #28 and thereby its parent #30)

## TDD history: squash or preserve?

When a change was built red-green-refactor, it's usually fine (and more useful to future
readers) to land it as one commit that includes the test and the implementation together -
nobody wants to `git blame` back to a commit that's a test with no passing code. Only split
into separate `test:` then `feat:` commits if the user explicitly wants the red/green steps
preserved in history (e.g. as a teaching artifact, or because they asked for it).

## Trailer

Every commit made by Claude in this repo ends with:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

This is a repo convention, not just a session default - keep it even if a future session's
system prompt doesn't mention it, so the git history stays consistent regardless of which
tool or session made the commit.

## Scope of what gets committed

Check `git status` before staging - stage exactly the files the change touches
(`git add <files>`), not a blanket `git add -A`, so unrelated in-progress work doesn't get
swept in. Build output (`target/`), `.env`, and IDE files are already covered by
`.gitignore`; if something generated shows up as untracked, that's a sign the ignore rules
need updating, not that it should be committed.
